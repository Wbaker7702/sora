## Features

- **Soroban Command Builder**: Easily construct and run Soroban CLI commands directly from within VS Code. The Command Builder provides an intuitive interface for selecting commands, specifying options and flags, and previewing the generated command.

- **Command History**: View and re-run previously executed Soroban CLI commands. The Command History view displays a list of commands along with their timestamps, making it easy to track and repeat commands.

- **Soroban CLI Integration**: The extension automatically detects if the Soroban CLI is installed on your system. If the CLI is not found, it provides a convenient button to navigate to the Soroban CLI installation guide.

- **Sora Application Log Integration**: The extension looks for command history and other relevant logs generated by the Sora application. It works seamlessly with Sora to provide an integrated logging experience. Logs are stored in the following locations:
  - Linux: `~/.config/sora/logs/soroban-commands.log`
  - macOS: `~/Library/Logs/sora/soroban-commands.log`
  - Windows: `%USERPROFILE%\AppData\Roaming\sora\logs\soroban-commands.log`
