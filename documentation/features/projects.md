## Projects Dashboard

This central hub is where all your Soroban development projects come together, offering a clear overview and easy access to all your work.

The Projects dashboard is your central hub for managing Soroban projects. Here's what you'll find:

1. **Project List**: Displays all your projects with color-coded icons and project names.
2. **Project Count**: Shows the total number of projects you have.
3. **Search Bar**: Allows you to quickly find specific projects.
4. **Create New Project**: A button to initiate the project creation process.

## Creating a New Project

To create a new project:

1. Click the **"Create New Project"** button in the top right corner.
2. You'll see a modal with two tabs: **"New Project"** and "**Import Existing"**.

<div class="image-border">

</div>

Under the **"New Project"** tab:

1. **Project Name**: Enter a name for your new project.
2. **Project Path**: Choose where to save your project.
3. **With Example**: Toggle this to include example contracts. A hello-world contract is included by default.
4. Click **"Create"** to initialize your project.

::: tip
Including example contracts can be a great way to learn Soroban development best practices!

## Opening Projects

You can easily open your projects in your preferred code editor:

1. Click the **"Open With"** button next to a project.
2. A modal will appear showing available editors on your system.

<div class="image-border">

![Open Project](/public/features/projects/open-with-editor.png)

</div>

3. **Select** your **preferred editor** (e.g., Visual Studio Code).
4. Click **"Open"** to launch the project in the chosen editor.

::: info
SORA detects installed editors on your system automatically. Make sure your preferred editor is installed for it to appear in the list. Supported editors include **Visual Studio Code**, **WebStorm**, and **CLion**.
:::

## Project Management

Each project in the list offers quick actions:

- **Open With**: Opens the project in your chosen code editor.
- **Contracts**: Provides quick access to manage contracts within the project.
- **Delete**: Removes the project from SORA **(doesn't delete files from your system)**.

::: warning
While **SORA doesn't remove files from your system**, it will remove the project from the dashboard.

## Tips for Efficient Use

To make the most of the Projects dashboard:

1. **Use the Search Bar**: When you have multiple projects, use the search functionality to quickly find what you need.
2. **Regular Cleanup**: Remove projects you're no longer working on to keep your dashboard tidy.
3. **Naming Conventions**: Use clear, descriptive names for your projects to make them easy to identify.


## Behind the Scenes

While SORA provides a user-friendly interface, it's powered by Stellar's CLI tools. The app handles the complex command-line operations for you, making Soroban development more accessible.

For those interested in the underlying processes, SORA utilizes commands similar to `stellar contract init` when creating new projects, but you don't need to worry about the command-line syntax - SORA takes care of it all for you.
