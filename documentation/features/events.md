## Best Practices

1. **Use Descriptive Names**: When adding events, use clear and descriptive names to easily identify them later.
2. **Regular Cleanup**: Remove events that are no longer needed to keep your dashboard organized.
3. **Use Filters**: Utilize the filtering options to focus on specific contract events when debugging or monitoring.
4. **Monitor Performance**: Keep an eye on the number of events you're tracking, as a large number may impact performance.

## Behind the Scenes

SORA uses the Soroban CLI's `events` command to manage and display contract events. Here are some of the key operations performed:

- `soroban events`: Fetch events from the network
- `soroban events --start-ledger`: Retrieve events starting from a specific ledger
- `soroban events --contract-id`: Filter events by contract ID
- `soroban events --count`: Limit the number of events returned
- `soroban events --cursor`: Start fetching events from a specific cursor position
- `soroban events --event-type`: Filter events by type (e.g., 'contract', 'system', or 'all')
