## Logs Dashboard

The Logs Dashboard is your central hub for viewing and managing logs in SORA.

<!-- ![Logs Dashboard](/public/features/logs/dashboard.png) -->

Key components of the Logs Dashboard include:

1. **Command History**: A tab displaying the history of commands executed in SORA.
2. **Application Logs**: A tab showing detailed logs of SORA's operations.

## Command History

The Command History tab provides a chronological list of commands executed within SORA, offering powerful features for reviewing and reusing past commands.

Key features of the Command History:

1. **Timestamp**: Shows when each command was executed, helping you track your development timeline.

2. **Command**: Displays the full command that was run, including all arguments and options.

3. **Status**: Indicates whether the command was successful (green checkmark) or encountered an error (red X).

4. **Details**: Allows you to view more information about the command execution, including full output and any error messages.

5. **Copy Command**: A quick-copy button next to each command lets you instantly copy the command to your clipboard, ready for reuse or modification.

6. **Run Again**: With a single click, you can re-execute any previous command, streamlining repetitive tasks or helping you quickly retry operations with slight modifications.

7. **Filter and Search**: Easily find specific commands using the search bar, which filters commands in real-time as you type.

8. **Sort Options**: Sort your command history by timestamp, command type, or status to quickly locate specific operations.

### Using Command History Effectively

1. **Quick Command Reuse**:
   - To rerun a command, simply click the "Run" button next to the desired command.
   - This feature is particularly useful for repeating test operations or quickly switching between different contract interactions.

2. **Command Modification**:
   - Use the copy feature to quickly grab a previous command.
   - Paste it into your preferred text editor or directly into SORA's command input area.
   - Make any necessary modifications before running the command again.

3. **Troubleshooting**:
   - When encountering errors, use the "Details" view to see the full command output and error messages.
   - Compare successful and failed commands to identify potential issues in your inputs or contract state.

4. **Learning and Optimization**:
   - Review your command history to understand your development patterns.
   - Identify frequently used commands that might benefit from creating shortcuts or scripts.

5. **Collaboration and Support**:
   - Easily share your exact commands with team members or support staff by copying them directly from the history.
   - Include timestamps to provide context for when specific operations were performed.

::: tip
Combine the Command History with SORA's AI-powered Command Generator for even more powerful workflows. Use the history to understand your common patterns, then ask the AI to help you optimize or expand on these commands.

::: warning
Remember that the Command History may contain sensitive information, such as contract addresses or transaction details. Be cautious when sharing or screenshotting this section.

## Application Logs

The Application Logs tab offers a detailed view of SORA's internal operations.

<!-- ![Application Logs](/public/features/logs/application-logs.png) -->

Key features of the Application Logs:

1. **Timestamp**: Indicates when each log entry was recorded.
2. **Log Level**: Shows the severity or type of log (e.g., INFO, WARNING, ERROR).
3. **Message**: Provides the detailed log message.
4. **Component**: Identifies which part of SORA generated the log.

::: warning
Application Logs may contain sensitive information. Be cautious when sharing these logs and ensure you redact any private data.

## Using Logs for Troubleshooting

The Logs feature is an invaluable tool for troubleshooting issues in SORA:

1. **Command Errors**: If a command fails, check the Command History for the exact command used and any error messages.
2. **Application Issues**: Review the Application Logs for warnings or errors that might indicate the root cause of a problem.
3. **Performance Analysis**: Use logs to identify slow operations or frequent errors that might impact performance.

## Best Practices

To make the most of the Logs feature:

1. **Regular Review**: Periodically check your logs to catch potential issues early.
2. **Error Investigation**: When encountering an error, always consult the logs for more context.
3. **Log Retention**: Be aware of how long logs are retained and export important logs if needed.
4. **Privacy Awareness**: Remember that logs may contain sensitive information. Be cautious when sharing.

## Behind the Scenes

The Logs feature in SORA leverages various logging mechanisms to provide you with comprehensive information:

- **Command History**: SORA keeps track of CLI commands executed through its interface, storing them along with their outcomes.
- **Application Logs**: These are generated by SORA's internal processes, capturing everything from routine operations to error conditions.
