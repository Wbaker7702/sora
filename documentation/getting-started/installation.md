# Installing SORA

This guide will walk you through the process of installing SORA and its prerequisite, the Stellar CLI.

## Installing Stellar CLI

Before installing SORA, you need to install the Stellar CLI, which is used for Soroban smart contract development and Stellar operations.

::: info
The Stellar CLI is supported on Linux, macOS, and Windows (via WSL).
:::

To install the Stellar CLI:

1. Open your terminal.
2. Install Rust if you haven't already:
   ```sh
   curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
   ```
3. Install the Stellar CLI:
   ```sh
   cargo install --locked stellar-cli
   ```
4. Verify the installation:
   ```sh
   stellar --version
   ```

::: tip
If you're using a machine with Apple silicon, you may need to have Rosetta installed. You can install Rosetta by running `softwareupdate --install-rosetta` in your terminal.
:::

For more detailed instructions or alternative installation methods, refer to the [official Stellar CLI installation guide](https://developers.stellar.org/docs/tools/stellar-cli/).
