# Security Improvements: Input Sanitization and Escaping

## Overview

This document outlines the comprehensive security improvements made to address input sanitization and escaping vulnerabilities in the codebase. The changes prevent injection attacks such as XSS (Cross-Site Scripting) and command injection by implementing proper input validation and sanitization.

## Issues Addressed

### 1. Vulnerable String Replace Operations

**Problem**: Direct use of `string.replace()` method without global flag, leading to incomplete sanitization.

**Examples Found**:
- `filePath.split("/").pop().replace(".rs", "")` - Only replaces first occurrence
- `command.replace(/^"/, "").replace(/"$/, "")` - Incomplete quote removal
- `textContent.replace('Run', '')` - Only replaces first occurrence

**Solution**: Implemented proper sanitization functions with global regex flags and comprehensive escaping.

### 2. XSS Vulnerabilities

**Problem**: User input displayed without proper HTML escaping.

**Examples Found**:
- Command text displayed in UI components without escaping
- User input in toast notifications without sanitization
- Command output in dialogs without proper escaping

**Solution**: Added HTML escaping for all user-displayed content using `escapeHtml()` function.

### 3. Command Injection Vulnerabilities

**Problem**: User input directly concatenated into shell commands without sanitization.

**Examples Found**:
- Command builder accepting user input for shell commands
- Command history parsing without input validation
- File path handling without proper sanitization

**Solution**: Implemented command sanitization and shell argument escaping.

## Security Improvements Implemented

### 1. Comprehensive Sanitization Library (`/renderer/lib/sanitization.ts`)

Created a robust sanitization utility library with the following functions:

- `escapeHtml()` - Prevents XSS by escaping HTML special characters
- `escapeShellArg()` - Prevents command injection by escaping shell arguments
- `escapeJson()` - Safely escapes JSON special characters
- `sanitizeFilePath()` - Prevents directory traversal attacks
- `sanitizeCommandOutput()` - Removes control characters and ANSI codes
- `safeRemoveQuotes()` - Safely removes quotes using global regex
- `safeReplaceNewlines()` - Safely replaces newline sequences
- `validateAndSanitizeInput()` - Comprehensive input validation and sanitization
- `sanitizeCommandText()` - Sanitizes command text for safe execution
- `validateFileExtension()` - Validates file extensions
- `createSafeFilename()` - Creates safe filenames

### 2. Fixed Vulnerable Components

#### Command History Parsing (`/renderer/components/logs/command-history/command-history.tsx`)
- Replaced vulnerable string replacements with safe functions
- Added proper input validation and sanitization
- Implemented safe quote removal and newline replacement

#### Contract File Processing (`/renderer/components/contracts/Contracts.tsx`)
- Added file extension validation before processing
- Implemented safe filename creation
- Added proper input sanitization

#### Command History Display (`/renderer/components/logs/command-history/command-history-columns.tsx`)
- Added HTML escaping for all user-displayed content
- Implemented command text sanitization
- Added proper input validation for navigation

#### Command Builder (`/stellar-suite/media/commandBuilder.js`)
- Added input sanitization for all user inputs
- Implemented shell metacharacter removal
- Added proper validation before command execution

#### Command History Panel (`/stellar-suite/out/panels/CommandHistoryPanel.js`)
- Added command text sanitization
- Implemented shell metacharacter removal
- Added proper input validation

#### Command Builder Provider (`/stellar-suite/src/providers/CommandBuilderProvider.ts`)
- Added HTML escaping for command options
- Implemented input sanitization for command values
- Added proper escaping for labels

### 3. Test Coverage

Created comprehensive test suite (`/renderer/lib/__tests__/sanitization.test.ts`) covering:
- All sanitization functions
- Edge cases and error conditions
- Input validation scenarios
- Security vulnerability prevention

## Security Best Practices Implemented

### 1. Defense in Depth
- Multiple layers of sanitization
- Input validation at multiple points
- Output encoding for different contexts

### 2. Principle of Least Privilege
- Minimal necessary input processing
- Strict validation rules
- Safe defaults for invalid inputs

### 3. Fail Secure
- Invalid inputs are sanitized rather than rejected
- Safe fallbacks for all error conditions
- Graceful degradation of functionality

### 4. Comprehensive Coverage
- All user inputs are sanitized
- All outputs are properly encoded
- All file operations are validated

## Usage Guidelines

### For Developers

1. **Always use sanitization functions** instead of direct string manipulation
2. **Validate inputs early** and sanitize before processing
3. **Escape outputs** based on the context (HTML, JSON, shell, etc.)
4. **Use the provided test suite** to verify sanitization works correctly

### Example Usage

```typescript
import { escapeHtml, sanitizeCommandText, validateAndSanitizeInput } from 'lib/sanitization';

// For HTML output
const safeHtml = escapeHtml(userInput);

// For command execution
const safeCommand = sanitizeCommandText(userInput);

// For general input validation
const safeInput = validateAndSanitizeInput(userInput);
```

## Testing

Run the sanitization tests to verify all functions work correctly:

```bash
npm test -- sanitization.test.ts
```

## Future Recommendations

1. **Regular Security Audits**: Periodically review input handling code
2. **Automated Security Testing**: Integrate security testing into CI/CD pipeline
3. **Security Headers**: Implement proper security headers for web content
4. **Content Security Policy**: Add CSP headers to prevent XSS
5. **Input Validation**: Add server-side validation for all inputs

## Conclusion

These security improvements significantly reduce the risk of injection attacks and ensure that all user inputs are properly sanitized and validated. The comprehensive sanitization library provides a robust foundation for secure input handling throughout the application.
