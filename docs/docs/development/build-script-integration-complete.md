# Build Script Integration - Implementation Complete ?

## Status: ? COMPLETE

The build script integration feature has been fully implemented and is ready for use.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Build Script (`scripts/build.js`)
- ? Added `saveBuildRecord()` function
- ? Added `getGitCommit()` and `getGitCommitMessage()` helpers
- ? Modified `buildApplication()` to track timing and save records
- ? Builds automatically save records to `~/.sora/builds/pending/`

### 2. Electron File Watcher (`main/background.ts`)
- ? Added `watchBuildRecords()` function
- ? Watches both `{userData}/builds/pending` and `~/.sora/builds/pending`
- ? Automatically processes build records
- ? Saves to Electron Store
- ? Emits `build:completed` events to renderer
- ? Moves processed files to `processed/` directory

## How It Works

1. **Build Execution**: When you run `node scripts/build.js [platform]`, the script:
   - Tracks build timing
   - Captures git metadata (if available)
   - Creates a build record JSON file
   - Saves it to `~/.sora/builds/pending/{buildId}.json`

2. **Automatic Processing**: Electron automatically:
   - Detects the new JSON file via file watcher
   - Validates and parses the build record
   - Saves it to Electron Store
   - Emits event to renderer for real-time UI update
   - Moves file to `processed/` directory

3. **UI Update**: The build appears in:
   - DeploymentPipeline component
   - PipelineHistory view
   - Searchable via BuildSearchService

## Testing

To test the integration:

```bash
# Run a build (skip tests/lint for faster testing)
node scripts/build.js linux --skip-tests --skip-lint

# Check if record was created
ls ~/.sora/builds/pending/

# Verify in Electron app
# Open SORA app ? Deployment Pipeline ? History tab
# Build should appear automatically
```

## Files Modified

- `scripts/build.js` - Lines 101-182 (added helper functions and build tracking)
- `main/background.ts` - Lines 816-919 (added file watcher)

## Features

- ? **Automatic Tracking**: No manual intervention needed
- ? **Cross-Platform**: Works on macOS, Linux, and Windows
- ? **Real-Time**: Builds appear in UI immediately
- ? **Error Handling**: Failed builds are tracked with error status
- ? **Git Integration**: Captures commit hash and message when available
- ? **Searchable**: All builds are searchable via the search interface

## Next Steps

The integration is complete! You can now:
1. Run builds via scripts and they'll be automatically tracked
2. Search and filter builds in the UI
3. View build logs
4. Monitor build history

## Future Enhancements (Optional)

- Real-time log streaming during builds
- Build artifact storage
- Build notifications
- Build scheduling
- Multi-project build tracking
